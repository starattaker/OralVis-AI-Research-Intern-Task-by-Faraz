Dental Panoramic X-ray Tooth Numbering
This repository contains the code and resources for training a YOLOv8 model to perform tooth numbering on dental panoramic X-ray images using the FDI system.

Project Steps:
Dataset Loading and Unzipping: The dataset, provided as a zip file (ToothNumber_TaskDataset.zip), was uploaded and unzipped to a local directory (dataset).
Dataset Copy: A copy of the original dataset (dataset_copy) was created to perform cleaning and splitting without altering the original data.
Label File Cleaning: Invalid annotation rows (those not following the 5-value YOLO format) were removed from the label files in dataset_copy.
Dataset Splitting: The cleaned dataset (dataset_copy) was split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets. The image and corresponding label files were copied into separate directories (dataset_split/train, dataset_split/val, dataset_split/test).
Data Configuration: A data.yaml file was created to configure the dataset paths and class names for YOLO training, following the FDI tooth numbering system.
Environment Setup: Necessary libraries, including ultralytics, were installed using pip. A requirements.txt file was generated to list the project dependencies.
Model Training: A YOLOv8s model was trained on the prepared dataset using pretrained weights.
Model Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated on the validation and test sets to assess its performance. Key metrics (Precision, Recall, mAP@50, mAP@50-95) and visualizations (Confusion Matrix, Training Curves, Sample Predictions) were generated.
Post-Processing (Optional): (Include details here if you implemented and want to mention the post-processing logic for anatomical correctness).
